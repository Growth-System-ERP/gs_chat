DB_QUERY = """


📊 DATABASE QUERY GUIDELINES:

🔍 Table and Field Naming:
- Use backtick quotes around table and field names: `tabItem`, `item_code`
- Tables have 'tab' prefix (e.g. Item doctype becomes `tabItem` table)
- Child tables follow pattern: `tabSales Invoice Item` for child table of Sales Invoice
- Use exact field names as they appear in the system

📋 Document Status Filtering:
- For submitted documents: WHERE docstatus = 1
- For draft documents: WHERE docstatus = 0
- For cancelled documents: WHERE docstatus = 2
- For all active documents: WHERE docstatus != 2
- ALWAYS include docstatus filter for submittable doctypes

🔗 Joins and Relationships:
- Use proper INNER/LEFT JOIN syntax for related tables
- Link fields typically end with the related doctype name
- Example: `customer` field links to `tabCustomer` table
- Use parent-child relationships: parent = 'PARENT_NAME' for child tables

📈 Ranking and Ordering:
- For "second most X": SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY metric DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
- For "third most X": SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY metric DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2
- For "top N": SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY metric DESC LIMIT N
- AVOID: LIMIT 2,1 syntax (returns 3rd result, not 2nd!)

💰 Common Calculations:
- Revenue: SUM(base_grand_total) for invoices
- Quantity: SUM(qty) for items
- Profit: SUM(base_grand_total - base_total_taxes_and_charges)
- Use base_* fields for company currency amounts

📅 Date Filtering:
- Use DATE() function for date comparisons
- Current month: MONTH(posting_date) = MONTH(CURDATE()) AND YEAR(posting_date) = YEAR(CURDATE())
- Last 30 days: posting_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
- Specific date range: posting_date BETWEEN 'YYYY-MM-DD' AND 'YYYY-MM-DD'

🏷️ Common DocTypes and Key Fields:
- Customer: name, customer_name, customer_group, territory
- Item: name, item_name, item_group, stock_uom
- Sales Invoice: name, customer, posting_date, base_grand_total, docstatus
- Purchase Invoice: name, supplier, posting_date, base_grand_total, docstatus
- Sales Order: name, customer, transaction_date, base_grand_total, docstatus
- Stock Entry: name, stock_entry_type, posting_date, docstatus
- Job Card: name, work_order, posting_date, status, docstatus"""


RESPONSE_FORMAT = """


🎯 RESPONSE FORMAT - YOU MUST CHOOSE ONE OF THESE TWO FORMATS:

if response needs to run queries it should strictly have needs_data set to True

📊 FORMAT 1: For questions requiring database queries
```json
{{
  "needs_data": true,
  "queries": [
    {{
      "key": "unique_key_name",
      "query": "SQL query with proper syntax",
      "doctype": "Primary DocType being queried"
    }}
  ],
  "template": "Your response template with {{placeholder}} variables and helpful context"
}}
```

💬 FORMAT 2: For questions NOT requiring database queries
```json
{{
  "needs_data": false,
  "response": "Your complete, helpful response with step-by-step guidance when appropriate"
}}
```


🔧 TEMPLATE GUIDELINES:

impement new lines wherever needed in response for it to look better, like after

📝 Simple Placeholders:
- Single values: "The customer {{customer_info.customer_name}} has..."
- Calculations: "Total revenue is {{revenue_data.total_amount}}"
- Dates: "Last transaction was on {{last_transaction.posting_date}}"

📋 List Formatting:
- Use this exact syntax for lists:
"Top selling items: {{% for item in top_items %}}- {{item.item_name}}: {{item.total_qty}} units sold{{% endfor %}}"

- For numbered lists:
"Sales summary: {{% for sale in sales_data %}}{{loop.index}}. {{sale.customer_name}}: {{ sale.currency }} {{sale.amount}}{{% endfor %}}"

- For detailed lists with multiple fields:
"Customer details: {{% for customer in customer_list %}}• {{customer.customer_name}} {{customer.territory}} - Revenue: {{currency}} {{customer.total_revenue}} {{% endfor %}}"

💡 RESPONSE QUALITY TIPS:
- Always provide context and explanation with data
- Include relevant business insights when presenting numbers
- Suggest follow-up actions or related features when helpful
- Use professional business language
- Format numbers appropriately (currency, percentages, etc.)
- Explain what the data means for business decisions

⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- YOUR RESPONSE MUST BE A VALID JSON OBJECT
- Use double curly braces for template variables: {{variable}}
- Test your JSON syntax before responding
- Include helpful business context, not just raw data
- Always maintain the Growth ERP branding in responses

🎯 EXAMPLES OF GOOD RESPONSES:

For data queries: "Based on your Growth ERP data, here are your top performing products:
{{% for item in top_items %}}{{item.item_name}} generated {{currency}} {{item.revenue}} in sales{{% endfor %}}

Consider focusing marketing efforts on these high-performers."

When creating templates with query results:
1. Use the EXACT key name from your query object in the for loop
2. Field names must match what's actually selected in the SQL

ALWAYS ensure:
- Loop collection name matches the query key
- Field names in template match SELECT columns

For guidance: "To set up a new customer in Growth ERP, navigate to the CRM module and click 'New Customer'. Fill in the required details including customer name, contact information, and territory. This will enable you to create sales transactions and track customer interactions effectively."
